<BlogHeading />

**When one AI becomes many, and GitHub Issues become persistent memory**

## The Discovery

I was 30 minutes into a Claude Code session when I hit the context limit. Again.

That familiar message appeared, and I did what every developer does: I started a new session. Fresh context. Clean slate. Ready to continue.

Except... Claude picked up exactly where we left off. Not just the code—the *entire mental model*. The architectural decisions. The edge cases we'd discussed. The "why" behind every choice.

**How?**

The answer changed how I think about AI development. It's not about one conversation with Claude. It's about creating a *distributed intelligence* across multiple sessions, multiple issues, multiple parallel work streams.

This is the story of that discovery, and the system that emerged from it.

## The Series

This isn't theory. This is a live experiment you're watching unfold. Three posts, published over three weeks, each revealing a layer of how solo developers can harness distributed AI development.

**All three posts are bookmarkable now.** The content reveals progressively, but the ideas are already working in production.

### Part 1: Why Claude Code is a Stalactite

**[📖 Read Part 1 →](/blog/claude-code-stalactite)**

  **The Metaphor That Explains Everything**

  Why does Claude remember context across sessions when every conversation starts fresh? The answer lies in geology—and transforms how you architect AI-assisted projects.

  **You'll discover:**
  - Why GitHub Issues are crystallized knowledge
  - How one sentence can generate a complete spec
  - Why context limits aren't actually your problem
  - The moment Claude audits its own work

  *A mental model shift that makes distributed AI development intuitive.*

### Part 2: The 6-Step Workflow That Makes It Work

**[📖 Read Part 2 →](/blog/claude-code-workflow)**

  **The Pattern That Prevents Chaos**

  Understanding the stalactite is the "why." The workflow is the "how." Six steps that turn ephemeral conversations into production code without scope creep.

  **The 6-step cycle:**
  1. Issue-first thinking (before code exists)
  2. Worktree isolation (parallel universes)
  3. Batch development (small, complete chunks)
  4. Human review (the critical gate)
  5. Commit locally (never push mid-work)
  6. PR only when done (batches complete)

  *Real examples from this project—including the post you're reading now.*

### Part 3: The Collective - When One Claude Becomes Many

  **When One Becomes Many**

  Here's where it gets wild: multiple Claude sessions, working on different issues, coordinating through GitHub. Solo developer, distributed AI team.

  **The mental model shift:**
  - From "chatting with AI" to "orchestrating intelligence"
  - How parallel Claude sessions coordinate without talking
  - Real examples: Omega explored, Tech documented, Hunter planned
  - When NOT to use this approach (critical guardrails)

  *The culmination: a development model that shouldn't work—but does.*

## Why I'm Writing This

Every tutorial about AI development shows you the conversation. The back-and-forth. The clever prompts. The impressive outputs.

**No one shows you the system.**

I'm a solo developer who accidentally built a distributed AI development model. Not because I read about it—because I hit problems and solved them. Context limits. Scope creep. Lost context between sessions. Parallel work on multiple features.

The solutions crystallized into a pattern. A workflow. A way of structuring projects so Claude becomes more capable across sessions, not less.

**This series documents that system** while it's being used to create the posts you're reading. Meta? Absolutely. Useful? You tell me.

**Who this is for:**
- Solo developers using Claude Code
- Teams exploring AI-assisted development
- Anyone frustrated with context limits
- Developers who want distributed AI coordination

**What you'll learn:**
- Mental models that make Claude Code intuitive
- Practical workflows battle-tested in production
- When to use (and NOT use) these approaches
- Real examples, not theories
